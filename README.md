DESCRIPTION: LOAD_NEURON_DATA.PY FILE
1. Setting Up Logging
•	The logging module is configured to log info and error messages, making it easier to track the code’s progress or diagnose issues.
2. Loading a. mat File
•	The load_mat_file function:
o	Uses scipy.io.loadmat to read .mat files, which are common in scientific research (e.g., MATLAB data).
o	Logs a success or error message, helping catch issues during file loading.
3. Creating Input Sequences
•	The sequence_target function prepares the data for time-series modeling:
o	Splits the data (N_activity) into sequences of a specified length (seq_length).
o	For each sequence:
	X: Contains the sequence data (e.g., neuron activity over seq_length time steps).
	y: Contains the next value(s) in the sequence, serving as the prediction target.
o	Converts sequences to numpy arrays for compatibility with machine learning libraries.
o	Reshapes y into a 2D array if it's 1D, ensuring uniformity.
4. Preprocessing Data
•	The preprocess_data function:
o	Extracts the activity data (spk_arr) from the loaded .mat file.
o	Converts the data to a pandas DataFrame for easier manipulation and debugging.
o	Converts the DataFrame back to a numpy array (N_activity) for processing.
o	Calls sequence_target to create sequences (X) and targets (y).
o	Splits the data into training and testing sets using an 80-20 split:
	No shuffling: Ensures the sequence order is preserved, critical for time-series data.
5. Error Handling
•	The code includes robust error handling:
o	File Loading: Captures errors if the file path is incorrect or the file is invalid.
o	Key Access: Handles situations where the key 'spk_arr' is missing from the .mat file.
o	Data Suitability: Ensures the prepared data isn’t empty before splitting, raising errors if something went wrong earlier.
6. Logging Key Progress
•	Logs important milestones:
o	Successfully loading the file.
o	Creating the DataFrame and sequences.
o	Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
•	Logs errors at specific stages to pinpoint failures.

o	Enhanced understanding of how to handle real-world data complexities.
o	Built confidence in working with sequential data for machine learning pipelines.

DESCRIPTION: MAIN.PY FILE
1. Imported Necessary Libraries and Modules
•	I started by organizing the tools I needed:
o	Custom Modules: For loading and preprocessing data (load_mat_file, preprocess_data) and building the Transformer model (build_transformer_model).
o	Libraries: For plotting (matplotlib), scaling data (MinMaxScaler), and handling callbacks to optimize model training (EarlyStopping, ReduceLROnPlateau).
2. Loaded the Neuron Data
•	I specified the path to the .mat file containing neuron activity data.
•	I used the load_mat_file function to load this data into Python, ensuring it was ready for preprocessing.
3. Preprocessed the Data
•	To prepare the data for modeling:
o	Defined a sequence length of 100, breaking the data into chunks of 100-time steps.
o	Split the data into training and testing sets for model learning and evaluation.
4. Scaled the Data
•	Since neural network models perform better when data is normalized:
o	I used MinMaxScaler to scale both the inputs (X_train, X_test) and outputs (y_train, y_test) between 0 and 1.
o	Reshaped the input data appropriately to maintain compatibility with the Transformer's expected input shape.
5. Built the Transformer Model
•	Using the build_transformer_model function:
o	Defined the input shape as (sequence_length, num_features) based on the training data.
o	Built and compiled the Transformer model.
o	Explicitly built the model before calling model.summary() to verify the architecture.
6. Configured Training Callbacks
•	To make training efficient and prevent overfitting:
o	Added EarlyStopping to stop training if the validation loss didn’t improve for 5 epochs.
o	Added ReduceLROnPlateau to reduce the learning rate when validation loss plateaued, helping the model fine-tune itself.
7. Trained the Model
•	Trained the model on the training data using:
o	Batch size of 32: Allowed the model to process 32 sequences at a time.
o	5 epochs: Used as a starting point, balancing training time and model performance.
o	Monitored performance on the test set during training.
8. Evaluated the Model
•	After training, I used the test data to calculate:
o	Loss: The difference between predicted and actual neuron activity.
o	MAE (Mean Absolute Error): Another measure of prediction accuracy.
9. Visualized the Results
•	Predictions from the test set were inverse transformed to their original scale to match the actual values.
•	I wrote a function, plot_forecasting, to:
o	Compare actual and predicted neuron activity for multiple neurons.
o	Display graphs for the first 100-time steps of each neuron, with black lines for true activity and orange dashed lines for predictions.

Writing this pipeline helped me:
•	Practice handling time-series data and normalizing it for better model performance.
•	Understand the importance of callbacks like EarlyStopping to save time and resources.
•	Applying Transformer models beyond NLP tasks, like predicting neuron activity!
